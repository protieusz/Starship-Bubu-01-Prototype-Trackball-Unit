# Starship-Bubu-01-Prototype-Trackball-Unit
Solo trackball unit powered by my Omega Supreme all in one PMW3660 sensor trackball, PER56, RP2040 integrated module.

Trackball ball support, encoder support and encoder knob support are all printed from Ariamelon's Kiwano VIK module in her GitHub.

Upgraded with a janky case.

Uploaded both STEP and STLs for the case.  I already lost a lot of brain cells designing the case.  Currently the case needs to be sandwiched hot glue together or whatever glue you use.  I hot glue just in case shit happens and I have to take apart and fix stuff.  You can modified the STEP files to your likely to make the case more secure.  I am not going to do any more tinkering with this prototype trackball anymore. Do so at your own risk.

I will upload a build guide soon.

Final product is still being testing and still waiting for PER56 encoder to arrive. Firmware working flawlessly. Once the PER56 final piece arrives, then Starship Bubu-01 Prototype will be fully assembled and ready.
Design gerbers will be made public and since this solo trackball is designed using EasyEDA, Kicad pcb file conversion will be a headache so the pcb file will not be released. However, schematic pdf and BOM will be release. The parts are manually hand solder so if you want to print this pcb, 
be prepared to advanced soldering skills to solder 0402 size components and lots of wiring soldering. Print and use as your own risk! No support will be provided. Please follow the below licensing if you want to modify, use, etc.  Omega Supreme module BOM and gerber files will be release if its own repository which will be updated later on.
